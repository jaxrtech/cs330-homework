Prove the following statements. Show and explain \textbf{ALL} your work. Unless otherwise specified, give direct proofs.

\begin{problem}{1}[The sum of two even integers is always even.]

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.

Assume $a$ and $b$ are even.

Then by definition,\\
\indent\indent $a = 2m$ where $m$ is an integer,\\
\indent\indent $b = 2n$ where $n$ is an integer.

Then,\\
\begin{flalign*}
a + b &= (2m) + (2n)\\
 &= 2(m + n)
\end{flalign*}

Therefore $a + b$ is even by definition.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}[State the contrapositive of (for all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd) and prove it.]

\begin{flalign*}
\text{Given} &: \forall n \in \Z \, (n^2 \text{ odd} \cond n \text{ odd})\\
\text{Contrapositive} &: \forall n \in \Z \, (n \text{ even} \cond  n^2 \text{ even} )
\end{flalign*}

Let $n$ be an integer.

Assume $n$ is even.

Then by definition, $n = 2k$ where $k \in \Z$.

So $n^2 = (2k)^2 = (4)(k \cdot k) = 2k \cdot 2k$.

And two even integers multiplied are always even.

Therefore $n^2$ is even.
